  1. The O notation for this would be constant, as we're only doing one operation. 

  2. The O notation for this would be O(n), because we're repeating the same operation for as many people are in the room, so the amount of operations is dependent on the amount of people. 

2.  Even or Odd?
  The O notation/complexity is constant, it doesn't matter what the input is, we're running one operation, is it divisible by 2 with an outcome of 0. 

3. Are you here?
  This is log(n^2), we're running a nested for loop

4. Doubler
  O(n)

5. Naive Search
  O(n)

6. Creating pairs
  0(n^2)

7. Compute the sequence
  O(n)

8. Effcient Search
  O(log n)

9. Random Element
  O(1), preforming one operation, the size of the input doesn't matter. 

10. What am I?
  O(n)
